# Globon
A Real-Time Tracking and Solutions for a Sustainable Future

## Description
Globon is an innovative application in an age characterised by heightened environmental consciousness. Low levels of awareness concerning personal and collective carbon footprints have caused alarming problems of climate change.

The continuous improvement powered by the machine learning algorithms and feedback from the user will provide the very best recommendations and optimise the experience of the user. It helps fill in the gap between knowing about environmental impact and acting upon it by changing the way we assess and manage the environment towards an ever-greener future.
